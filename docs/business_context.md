# Business Context – Procurement Priority Engine

## 📌 The Challenge
Procurement teams face constant trade-offs:
- **Service levels vs. working capital**: Keeping high stock availability often ties up cash.
- **Profitability vs. risk**: Not all SKUs contribute equally to margin, yet stockouts can damage customer trust.
- **Demand variability vs. forecast accuracy**: Uncertainty in demand makes safety stock planning complex.

Traditional procurement systems often rely on static reorder points or simplistic ABC classification. These approaches fail to capture the **multi-dimensional reality** of modern supply chains.

## 🎯 The Solution
The Procurement Priority Engine provides a **config-driven, enterprise-style framework** to prioritize procurement decisions. It integrates:

- **Service-level policies** → Differentiate Core, Support, and Tail items.
- **Safety stock logic** → Balance forecast error and service-level buffers.
- **Dynamic min–max policy** → Adaptive reorder thresholds based on demand and lead time.
- **ABC/XYZ classification** → Combine profit contribution with demand variability.
- **Profitability tiers** → Ensure capital is allocated to high-margin SKUs.
- **Config-driven scoring** → Transparent, auditable prioritization aligned with governance standards.

## 📈 Business Impact
- **Reduce stockouts**: Align orders with risk and demand variability.
- **Optimize working capital**: Prioritize profitable SKUs, avoid over-investment in low-margin items.
- **Executive-ready outputs**: Transparent scoring breakdowns for dashboards and decision-making.
- **Global adaptability**: Configs externalized in YAML for easy tuning across regions and industries.

## 🌍 Strategic Alignment
This framework is inspired by **SAP IBP** and **Azure Supply Chain AI**, but adapted for practical deployment in smaller or regional businesses. It demonstrates how **global best practices** can be localized while maintaining auditability and governance.

## 📌 Use Cases
- **Retail chains**: Prioritize fast-moving, high-margin SKUs while managing seasonal variability.
- **Manufacturers**: Balance service levels for critical components vs. tail items.
- **Distributors**: Optimize procurement across multiple supplier regions with varying lead times.
